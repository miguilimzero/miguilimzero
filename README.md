### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer and Entrepreneur who likes to follow best coding practices and develop maintainable code. My programming language of focus is PHP, and I'm specialized in data-intensive applications and blockchain solutions.

### What I'm Working On

I'm currently working at [Crypto Unifier](https://cryptounifier.io/) and its sub-products, aiming to offer a payment processor with a solid and unified API of multiple blockchains and cryptocurrencies.
