### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer and Entrepreneur who likes to follow best coding practices and develop maintainable code. My primary programming language of focus is PHP, and I'm specialized in blockchain solutions and data-intensive applications.

I'm working at [Crypto Unifier](https://cryptounifier.io/) and its sub-products, aiming to offer a payment processor with a solid, unified API of blockchains and cryptocurrencies.

While developing my proprietary products, I have also released open-source packages, such as [AntiBotLinks](https://github.com/srdante/antibotlinks), [Dom Parser](https://github.com/srdante/dom-parser), [Jetstream Plus](https://github.com/cryptounifier/jetstream-plus), and [LIBSSH2 IDE Helper](https://github.com/srdante/libssh2-ide-helper).


#### Open-source Contributions 

As part of my work, I've contributed to several open-source projects over the last few years. Some of these projects include [SingleStore Laravel Driver](https://github.com/singlestore-labs/singlestoredb-laravel-driver), [DDNet](https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet), [Laravel Socialstream](https://github.com/joelbutcher/socialstream), [Web3.php](https://github.com/web3p/web3.php), [Laravel Jetstream](https://github.com/laravel/jetstream).

In this year 2023 I started as a new objective to contribute to the [GNOME Project and Linux Ecosystem]().
